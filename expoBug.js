This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and you're working with a project that uses a library or a feature that isn't fully compatible with Expo's managed workflow or has some dependency conflicts.  The exact error message might vary, but often involves a module not being found or a build process failure.  It is often difficult to diagnose because the root cause can be subtle, such as an incompatibility between a native module and the Expo SDK version.
