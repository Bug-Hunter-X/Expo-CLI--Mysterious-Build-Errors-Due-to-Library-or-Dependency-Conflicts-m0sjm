The solution involves carefully examining the project's dependencies and ensuring compatibility.  Here's a breakdown of debugging steps:

1. **Check `package.json`:** Carefully examine the dependencies listed in your `package.json`. Look for any libraries that might be known to have issues with Expo or have conflicting version requirements.
2. **Update Dependencies:** Run `expo upgrade` followed by `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.  This step often resolves the problem if it stems from outdated packages.
3. **Identify Conflicts:** Utilize tools like `npm-check-updates` (for npm) or `yarn why` (for Yarn) to find incompatible or outdated packages. If conflicts are found, resolve them according to the tool's instructions.
4. **Check Native Module Compatibility:** If your project uses native modules, verify that they are compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Consult the module's documentation for compatibility information.
5. **Use EAS Build:**  Try using Expo's EAS Build service.  EAS Build often has better compatibility with various libraries and might provide more informative error messages.  This is usually the best approach when the issue persists.
6. **Simplify and Isolate:** If you can't identify the issue, try creating a minimal, reproducible example.  Strip your project down to only the essential code that reproduces the error. This isolated project helps pin down the source of the problem.
