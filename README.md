# Expo CLI: Mysterious Build Errors Due to Library or Dependency Conflicts

This repository demonstrates a common yet difficult-to-diagnose issue in Expo CLI projects.  The problem arises from conflicts or incompatibilities between installed libraries or dependencies.  The precise error message can vary greatly, making it challenging to identify the root cause.

## Reproducing the Bug

The `expoBug.js` file shows a simplified example of how an incompatibility might manifest. The exact libraries and dependencies involved will vary based on the project.

## Solution

The `expoBugSolution.js` file contains strategies to solve the error. This generally involves meticulously reviewing the project's `package.json` file.  Common solutions include:

* **Updating dependencies:** Use `expo upgrade` and `npm update` or `yarn upgrade` to ensure all packages are up to date.
* **Resolving version conflicts:** Use tools like `npm-check-updates` or `yarn why` to check for conflicting package versions and resolve them.
* **Checking for incompatible native modules:**  Verify that any native modules used are compatible with the current Expo SDK version.
* **Using EAS Build:** If difficulties persist, consider using Expo's EAS Build service, which often provides better compatibility and error reporting.
* **Creating a minimal reproducible example:** If you still need help, create a minimal project that reproduces the issue and share it for others to assist with debugging.
